# THINKIT – Text-to-Speech (TTS) Web Platform

**THINKIT** is a responsive Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application designed to assist users—especially students with reading difficulties such as dyslexia—by converting typed text into spoken audio. It aims to improve reading comprehension, focus, and engagement through interactive learning.

## Purpose of Development

This project was created to:
- Help learners bridge the gap between written and spoken language.
- Provide an accessible, browser-based tool with no installation required.
- Strengthen my practical skills in web development and UI/UX design.
- Explore how technology can enhance educational experiences.

## Key Features

- Text-to-Speech conversion using the Web Speech API.
- Custom voice selection with pitch and rate control.
- Real-time word and character counters.
- A clean, responsive user interface for desktop and mobile.
- Progress tracking with level-up animations and scoring.
- Virtual keyboard visualizer and feedback messages.
- "Common Phrases" buttons for practice and engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure and content layout.
- **CSS** – Styling, responsiveness, and layout animations.
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity, logic, speech synthesis, progress tracking.

## What I Learned

- Implementing browser-based speech synthesis using the Web Speech API.
- Creating accessible and responsive UI components using pure CSS.
- Structuring interactive JavaScript applications.
- Handling DOM events efficiently and providing real-time feedback.
- Enhancing user experience through animations and gamification.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility with the Web Speech API.
- Managing input validation and feedback without overwhelming the user.
- Designing a UI that’s both functional and visually simple for early learners.
- Making the application mobile-friendly without using frameworks.
- Handling edge cases like empty inputs and voice mismatches.
